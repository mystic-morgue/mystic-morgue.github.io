						We had the pleasure of participating in the Valencia Indie Summit this past May 16th, 17th, and 18th. This event is a fantastic opportunity for small and large studios alike to showcase their games, whether they're demos, full releases, or works in progress.
					</p>
				
					<p class="legible">
						We brought a small demo of our game, and we were thrilled to see so many people stop by our booth to play it. It was incredibly motivating to see that most players completed the entire demo, as this was our first experience with real users.
					</p>
				
					<p class="legible">
						The feedback we received was invaluable. Everyone who tried our game was not only enthusiastic but also provided us with constructive comments that have helped us refine our approach. Thanks to their input, we are now better guided in our development process.
					</p>
				
					<p class="legible">
						In addition to meeting passionate gamers, we made many new friends among fellow developers. Though we couldn't try every game, we did get to play quite a few, and we were impressed by the creativity and quality on display.
					</p>
				
					<p class="legible">
						Overall, the experience was incredibly positive and motivating. We are deeply grateful to everyone who visited our booth and shared their thoughts. Your support and feedback are essential to us, and we can't wait to apply what we've learned and continue improving our game.
				
					</p>
				
					<p class="legible">
						Thank you all for making the Valencia Indie Summit such a memorable event!
