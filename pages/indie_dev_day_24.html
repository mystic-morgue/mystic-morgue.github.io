				We went to the Indie Dev Day! Unfortunately we only were able to be there two days so we could not bring our own stand, that would have been amazing, what a pitty.
			</p>

				Buuuuut, we went!!, and we had fun, we had the opportunity to revisit some of our friends from the <u>Valencia Indie Summit</u>, we brought some support for them but didn't had infinite time and we wanted to make some new friends :) 
			</p>
		
			<p class="legible">
				And you can take for granted we did, we made a lot of new friends with a bunch of different and unique games.

				Didn't we tell you? Well, yes, we were finalists for AEVI's 7th Innovation Grants! Unfortunately, we couldn't be there on the day of the award ceremony and no, we didn't win either. But the winners were the amazing team at <a href="https://halfsunkgames.com/">Half Sunk Games</a> with their awesome game, Dream Observatory. We had the chance to try a bit of their game and honestly, they totally deserved it.

				We are very grateful to all the developers who talked with us, as we have to admit that, yes, sometimes the questions we asked weren’t exactly easy, haha.
			</p>
		
			<p class="legible">
				We leave super happy and eager to come back. In fact, we’re already thinking of heading to the WEIRD Marquet later this week!
